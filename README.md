# MUSA 650: Machine Learning in Remote Sensing

## Week4: 

We will have another hands-on class with multiple examples. Our main goal this week will be to have a better understanding of the intuition of different classification algorithms.

- [It's good to go over existing scripts but what I will do if I don't have it?](python_ml_bootcamp_A.ipynb)
- [What does a classifier learns](Prac6_classifier_comparison_v1.ipynb)
- [What does a classifier learns, second part](Prac7_classifier_comparison_v2.ipynb)
- An introduction to ML on satellite images, if we have some additional time ...
